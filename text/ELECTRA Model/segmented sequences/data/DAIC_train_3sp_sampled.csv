369,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_32.wav, other than that I let you know so depression kind of goes with anxiety if it's not under control but now it's under control so I have a great huh,0
370,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_33.wav, no I think it was what they call fleece free floating anxiety more of a organic reason for it in other words that there was a chemical imbalance,0
371,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_34.wav, I've been feeling pretty good actually the holidays were great good family gatherings a little stressed because we're making a big decision right now to help my parents out my dad is really sick and we've offered to move in with them they have a big home but we would have to do a lot of,0
372,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_35.wav, some renovation and some to help and some obviously moving around and so we're in the throes of that and so that's a big big change but I'm looking forward to it because I really don't want my parents to be alone as they get their in their 80s,0
373,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_36.wav, so as I get closer to death I want to have my family there with them,0
374,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_37.wav, not easy usually all my life I think I've always I mean I've always had at least I wake up at least once in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom basically,0
375,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_38.wav, other than that I mean no not sleep well I mean other than that I sleep well but sometimes if I wake up like really early in the morning then I can't go back to sleep I'll get up and maybe do some work on the computer and then go back to bed and go back to sleep because I want my schedule is when if the kids are have to be at the school early and there's a lot of factors,0
376,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_39.wav, probably basically the same I think I might complain the bit like oh I'm tired or my body hurts or whatever you know but I think overall I'm probably the same,0
377,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_40.wav, my kids know I'll be there I'll tell my get though I'm really tired and they'll understand like my older daughter will be really helpful and letting my the. I will try to cook dinner or something like that so that you know,0
378,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_41.wav, not really not not no,0
379,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_42.wav, actually yes I do I do feel like therapy is useful,0
380,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_43.wav, she also suffers from anxiety and we have had her in therapy for some time and we just recently our we're about to finish a group with her it was a 6 months,0
381,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_44.wav, group for DVT it's called and it's like a the first time that is the first time they're documenting using it with teenagers and it's been really good it's been very helpful it's just all about how to live in the moment and how do you know the actual physical and mental strategies to keep you or keep you from your mind from going crazy you know worrying about things or we know,0
382,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_45.wav, in this case some of the kids have tried to harm themselves or whatever so that's the focus of the therapy and it's been really good my husband and I both have been going with our daughter and it's been really really informational and really helpful I think,0
383,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_46.wav, oh my God I was she was in a bad way she was being all suffering a lot and we knew it and we acted on it that's all,0
384,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_47.wav, really joyful and happy I would say probably,0
385,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_48.wav, probably would be in Israel when we renewed our marriage vows in the the ethic in Cana,0
386,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_49.wav, so you know where the wedding of Cana took place that was really moving and beautiful and it was it happened that our anniversary was we left on our anniversary day we flew to Israel on so it was right at the same time it was beautiful,0
387,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_50.wav, find meaningful and other than that I would say you know like other joyful occasions have been you don't like Christmas and you know family gatherings and you know my dad's birthday turned 83 on Christmas Eve you know that kind of think so,0
388,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_51.wav, once I get like things done that I need to do like if I'm have a lot of a lot of either work to do around the house or,0
389,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_52.wav, answer one once I get them done I feel like I could sense of accomplishment,0
390,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_53.wav, you know much like I mean I worked for many years in it as an administrative manager at UCLA and,0
391,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_54.wav, you don't want to get a project done or you get your whatever month-end stuff done or there's a lot of different things that have to meet deadlines or so that feeling of like yeah I got it done you know so I think that would be a no for me the most,0
392,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_55.wav, most recent way of feeling good and feeling you know like feeling accomplished,0
393,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_56.wav, I think I've already lived it I'm also a birth Doula and yeah and so I've attended a lot of Earth and now I really only do it for family and friends and it's the most rewarding thing you could possibly ask to be involved in is the birth of bringing a new life into this world so I would say that's probably was my was a dream job and I didn't know what I trained much after you know I did my managerial stuff and,0
394,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_57.wav, with all it is and was awesome so I don't work at a hospital anymore actually the hospital that I work at is now closed but,0
395,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_58.wav, I attended a friend of mine's Birth by accident she up she happen to have the same old BS I did with all my children and I came to bring food for her husband when she was in labor we were freaking out close friends and you know her labor picked up quite a bit when I got there she wanted me to say she didn't want me to leave I hadn't planned on it so that was the first birthday I attended outside of it you know myself giving birth which is a whole different experience so after that it was really interesting and interested in possibly setting nurse-midwifery,0
396,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_59.wav, but then I discovered this thing called being a doula which is really gives you even a lot more Hands-On one-on-one contact with the patient which is what I like,0
397,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_60.wav, so I tried to do that at the hospital in Inglewood about 15 years ago cuz my son is 15 and he was a year Old Mill 16 years ago so,0
398,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_61.wav, well it can be challenging in terms of hours it depends on how long the woman is in labor but and you know also like for me I always tell my friends and family if they want me to be there dual that I cannot guarantee 100% I'm not doing it for business and that way and because of that I don't have like backup doulas that in case I'm sick or I'm not available somebody else could fill in for me so but so far it's been that all the women that have asked me I've been able to be there for some reason still there,0
399,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_62.wav, the the only one that I missed was one A friend of mine from church who wanted me to go with her second baby I was with her for her first but her labor went so fast you didn't call me in the middle of the night and she was like two hours of Labor she would even if it called me I would have been there in time so I went really fast but other than that you know,0
400,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_63.wav, yeah I've been I've been able to attend all the verse of people that have asked me to do,0
401,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_64.wav, probably might my own births I mean my the birth of my own children,0
402,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_65.wav, sense of Joy excitement relief because of course you're out of the pain and then like it's just it's just a matter of you know going forward from there but it's it's like something you can explain it's just it's awesome after you give birth so,0
403,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_66.wav, and I've experienced both ways I've done both natural and I at my last job was a spy a C-section so I've had both both experiences,0
404,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_67.wav, all right with my Fairchild had kind of a crazy nurse she was a little psychotic but other than that we laugh about it now but when I was in labor it wasn't funny and she,0
405,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_68.wav, she was not there when the doctor I mean it was my third child was,0
406,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_69.wav, born very quickly after he broke the water and wolf my husband was there but she was not in there with the doctor and she got in a lot of trouble because I only had like two contractions after that and my daughter was born in the bed so for me it was great cuz I didn't have to go through any of the labor but I'm sure they weren't happy that you fill out a lot of paperwork after that,0
407,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_70.wav, 10 or 20 years ago is probably more not as some relaxed not as,0
408,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_71.wav, I don't have the same concerns that I did then it's I don't worry about I don't worry at all about what people think about me I don't worry at all about what you know you know like why I noticed my daughters on Mom you can't wear that because people are going to say this I said I don't care you know but they do because it's still in their frame of mind that owe mom you have to dress like this or just like that or whatever so that would probably be at the wisdom that you you achieve with AIDs that you do see how life there's so many things that are more important in life than worrying about little things,0
409,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_72.wav, probably my family like my husband and my my children I mean the fact that we've stayed married that we weren't intact family that my kids see every day how their friends suffer who who come from divorced families or single parents and they they actually Express gratitude sometimes that we are married and we still you know we are still a family so I would say that's probably it,0
410,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_73.wav, probably the one of my best qualities is being able to listen to people and being able to not be judgemental through the years I've had a lot of experience with,0
411,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/314_P_seg_74.wav, people with problems lot of friends with problems people I know from church and it's just taught me that everybody has weaknesses everybody has problems and I don't think I'm better than someone else if you think you're better than someone else and that's usually to me a sign that you don't know yourself well enough,0
412,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/315_P_seg_0.wav,okay,0

420,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/315_P_seg_8.wav, try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind when usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in the room by myself and just try to clear my head in my head,0

711,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/328_P_seg_8.wav, no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find a negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know * 152 deal with that but other than that it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy,0
712,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/328_P_seg_9.wav, the hardest thing about being a parent I would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you want to give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't want to take it they want to find their own way and watch them get hurt and it's sad and then they want to come in your life. I tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way,0
713,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/328_P_seg_10.wav, yeah I guess for a while when you think about it when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they want to learn cuz once they get it they got it so however they get it as a pair of your happy they got it,0
714,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/328_P_seg_11.wav, all the love the children bestow upon you is great they yeah they let you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me she always tells me I'm doing a great job when does she know about a great job she's only seven but you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so I like that,0
715,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/328_P_seg_12.wav, I got there you know like Albert Einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out their kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they missed going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to YouTube are you know wherever Facebook and in getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up its pushed and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong,0

1008,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/352_P_seg_24.wav, probably just like the fact that I I really tried to live my life with like no regrets and just I tried to live a very exciting life in a way and I think that especially ever since I finished college and have been traveling like I haven't I've tried moving all different places by myself so I think just the fact that I am not really afraid I don't let things hold me back I just if I want something or if I want to do something I just do it and I guess in a way like I like that about myself in the fact that I'm really independent and can just go and do whatever I feel like doing even if it's hard I still I'm proud that I've overcome a lot of those struggles,0
1009,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/352_P_seg_25.wav, oh there's like minor things that I regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major cuz I think pretty much everything that I've done I've learned from whether it's good or bad so I wouldn't really change anything,0
1010,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/352_P_seg_26.wav, I would say I would tell myself when I was a kid that I,0
1011,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/352_P_seg_27.wav, should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything is possible because I guess as I've grown into an adult I've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and then if you really want something you can go after and you can get it and so I would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you want to do,0
1012,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/352_P_seg_28.wav, oh I guess I went home recently for Christmas back to Oklahoma and I got to see some of my friends from college that I hadn't seen in some of them I haven't seen in like since I graduated so much has been like 4 years ago so it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun,0

1559,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_10.wav, my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know I lose my parents still like I said I'm 23 years old you know there's certain times when I can be a little bit shaky little bit Rocky but for the most part it's it's pretty good you know I've matured a lot in the last few years so things are getting back up to speed I would say things are things are going pretty well,0
1560,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_11.wav, you know I think it's them somewhere kind of in the middle you know sometimes I can be very outgoing and talkative the people when I'm relaxed and laid-back other times I kind of it's not so much like I go into my shell but you know it's times like I can be kind of shy if I don't know people as well or if I haven't never met them before so it's one of those things that Kanye kind of got to meet me in the Middle with it because you know I can neither be talked very talkative or a x you know I can be a little bit shy but you know once I once I get the conversation going really talkative then so,0

1562,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_13.wav, you know I've actually been better with that couple years back unite points were like I pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever and I I mean I would just pretty much get angry you know the littlest things everything would just kind of ticked me off but you know I've definitely learned to you no control that sort of thing and you know it may be a better person because of it,0
1563,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_14.wav, well let's see I'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe I can't remember off the top of my head but you know it's it's always something so minuscule that that's why I probably don't remember it but you eventually we make up and I apologize for it because you know I accept that you know I'm wrong and you know certain circumstances,0
1564,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_15.wav, something that I feel guilty about probably you know not being as nice to others as I could have been in the past you know I mean that is the past and you know I don't like this wall in that sort of thing but I think that's one thing that I tried to work on but it's also one thing that I kind of regret not doing just being just being nice,0
1565,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_16.wav, Precision I ever had to make a pretty recent kind of tough because I actually have a buddy he was in the Air Force and you recently got diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's not really all there anymore like we used to be so it's one of those things where I feel like I'm kind of ignoring him and I don't want to do that but at the same time I don't know is Tennessee's you could be a little crazy so,0
1566,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_17.wav, probably like me on some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so I don't know but yeah,0
1567,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_18.wav, yeah it's pretty tough and I cuz we go way back been best friends with them since I was about five six years old so it's just it's just really hard to deal with but you know I try to I don't I don't you know try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there I don't ever forget so,0
1568,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_19.wav, well you probably say that you know I'm a pretty pretty down-to-earth guy usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know I try to work on that to you probably say that I'm pretty funny I like to hang out you know just kind of do things here and there you know I'm just normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watching movies and I'll grab a few beers I started deal so,0
1569,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_20.wav, yeah it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if I'm really tired and you know I'll probably have a very good sleep I've been sleeping all that great the last few days cuz you know my house there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new Roofing so that's kind of tough that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part usually get pretty good sleep,0
1570,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_21.wav, feeling lately lately I feel pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up I actually got an internship about a month ago for you know my field of Journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so I'm looking forward to that I'm starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good and yeah things are just going pretty well right now I can't complain,0
1571,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_22.wav, yeah it's it's not bad you know like I said it could always be worse right but you know I'm enjoying life so that's the that's the best part,0
1572,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_23.wav, last time I felt really happy man you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had a sanity I guess you could say I came back to visit from the Air Force you get some leave so you know you're just hanging out no just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that was nice but I miss that you know so,0
1573,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_24.wav, I feel great do you know it because there's nothing like having a best friend and you can have conversation you know 24/7 about anyting you tell anything to him in confidence and you can tell me anything in confidence is like it's hard to find especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so,0
1574,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_25.wav, yeah there there's a probably one or two things that I regret well I mean I got a DUI about three or four years ago actually was four years ago that's something that I definitely regret because you know I look back on it and you know things might have been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions no circumstances that took place so you know I may end up in you. I guess I think I better off for it but at the same time you know it's always going to be in the back of my mind like I said it's just one of those things you have to do within your own way,0
1575,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_26.wav, well you know it's one of those things like I was a child then so I really don't know what to say I mean even if I would have listened then who knows but you know I probably would have told myself you know just be careful you don't make sure you can be the best person you possibly can candy basically you know just always be nice be honest just be caring for others so,0
1576,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_27.wav, probably going back to my buddy with the whole paranoid schizophrenic thing I don't say that I wish I could erase it I just wish that it didn't happen like that so,0

1578,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_29.wav, probably just you know be nicer like I said before baby not being as lazy have more determination I mean I I have quite a bit of determination I know what I want to do with my life but I know there were times when I kind of get a little lackadaisical and so I wish I could improve upon that and not procrastinate is much so,0
1579,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_30.wav, well you know it's it's tough to think back but I would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad as you know I would say probably like when I was kind of getting angry at certain people maybe just kind of chewing out my friends when I probably shouldn't have I'll try to give him more constructive criticism but at the same time I knew it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and they were out of characters,0
1580,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/379_P_seg_31.wav, the best qualities I would say that I'm definitely hardworking I'm determined a very caring now More Than I Used to Be,0

1591,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_5.wav, but no I I travel meet us at met by probably traveled more than most people in the US like considering that most people don't travel in the US but I wouldn't I wouldn't call myself a world Traveler,0
1592,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_6.wav, I enjoy the chance to get to like see other walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the,0
1593,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_7.wav, the specificity of my own you know the the the given the parameters that I grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally I mean even just within the US like seeing how someone in California grows up is so different from how someone in Maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like Thailand or something growing up it's pretty pretty amazing,0
1594,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_8.wav, it's been awhile since I've been on a trip I guess one of the last trips I did was to,0
1595,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_9.wav, I made a lot like two years ago I went on a road trip across the u.s. and that was that was pretty amazing saw but I guess the best put the best two places on the drive from Maryland to LA this is before I actually moved out here but I visited New Orleans and New Orleans was just this whole like even though it's part of the us it's like a totally it's totally different than anywhere else it's so unique the culture they are so unique and and the blend of like Caribbean in French and all these other influences into like the American South is so so yeah it's just it's it's unreal,0
1596,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_10.wav, can you come back to that question are you capable of that,0
1597,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_11.wav, you know that's actually a question I've been asking myself I knew I know my entire life I've had like phases of Interest so when I was like very very very young I was really into like the first phase that I remember was keys and then tools like a girl around collecting keys and then I go around collecting tools like just every sort why the toolbox my parents have told me that I had faced before that with his balls like various balls and then I was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and instead like animals and then the dinosaur phase and at a certain point I got really into like rat like music like the first rap and then guitar and then acting and then it's some point in their I I I remember telling someone that right now I'm interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually I was going to be interested in in,0
1598,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_12.wav, film think I could kind of see the trajectory coming but I don't remember what led me to that conclusion I think I just always I would love to sheltered life as far as movies are concerned I didn't my parents didn't let me see an R-rated movie until I was like in high school of us like and and I never signed a lease on R-rated movie I was also very squeamish like I remember when I was fairly young maybe like 6 I saw Star Wars the first seen a Dark Star Wars Darth Vader cracked like brakes a guy's neck at just a little scene bear at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and I had to leave the room so,0
1599,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_13.wav, yeah it's it's it's I'm not exactly sure how I got into film but I've always been fascinated by like how people interact in what like you know acting and stuff something movies in general,0
1600,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_14.wav, to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and put together and like I cuz I don't use that word so much cuz I think I think of it more as like I want the opportunity to put together and make movies or to make movies is probably the best way to do it to say it cuz I want you and I want involvement in all the all the processes but,0
1601,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_15.wav, I guess the best Parable for that would be a director directing,0

1608,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_22.wav, I'm not I probably we consider myself on the scheme of extraversion are on the scale of extraversion sorry I would consider myself extremely introverted,0
1609,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_23.wav, I just I see other extroverts in just a matter who they're around there a little like strike up conversations in a fairly shy person them sort of like or inhibited person maybe,0

1612,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_26.wav, I enjoy a vicious debate but I don't,0
1613,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_27.wav, as long as my like cuz I won't like revert to personal you know attacks in my in my arguments I try to keep it on subject and try to explain myself as best I can which can get frustrating cuz I'm not like the best articulator of what I think one of my weekly points I would say,0
1614,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_28.wav, but I but the last time I had a heated debate I think that was not the question,0
1615,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_29.wav, when is the last time that happened what happened I forgot I forgot to mention that that I had a heated debate,0
1616,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_30.wav, was had a heated debate about the movie Boogie Nights I didn't lose my temper exactly but I like very extremely passionate about about that I don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who I was I was arguing with her saying that it was like one of the like best best movies why did they think it was the best movies,0
1617,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_31.wav, they think that like there's something there's some sort of as I understand it they have,0
1618,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_32.wav, they have a certain they think that the,0
1619,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_33.wav, take all of the stories with in Boogie Nights they have their own like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole lake complexity of character within the movie and,0
1620,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_34.wav, what were they saying they were saying like the movie,0
1621,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_35.wav, it's like it's like the end of an era which makes it look kind of like casino and there's this attention to detail of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot kind of like,0
1622,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_36.wav, yeah I guess I think the heated debate became about like that so from there and like personally it's not like a bad mood or anything but it's the I just don't think Dirk Diggler is like that like me meaning full of a character like I like it the way I come out I came out of the movie cuz I had seen it before many years ago night at my opinion of it is basically the same even though like I remember it like in watching it again I was able to re-evaluate it there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing I like articulable about that sleeps has a good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool that you know it's cool it's but but it's meat for me it was like meaningless and then two and then they were that let us to discuss the movie that I recently that I really did like his Django Unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was the Sixth Street I get the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the mood,0
1623,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_37.wav, Django Unchained you have Django and jango's like it kind of has a two dimensional character but I don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is and you have dr. King Schultz who's this who's this like his mentor character and the person I was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would have risked his life to save Django or like would have gone into this like second act where they go and they go to the plantation to deceive Django's wife excetera and and the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not,0
1624,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_38.wav, sacrificed himself for someone else which straight which strikes me as so like,0
1625,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_39.wav, like who like she's her bit her basic argument was that like altruism doesn't it cuz it was too. I even ran type of argument altruism doesn't exist the only the only thing you can do is sit like the only thing people do is serve them self so it's not quite Iron Man but it's like the only thing that people like old people are out to serve himself which I'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism in and something like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor in an in like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate,0
1626,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_40.wav, hurt like if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so let it to an extremely passionate debate and somewhat like yeah it is said that,0
1627,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_41.wav, so so yeah that that I guess that's the I don't think I necessarily like lost my temper I think I'm losing my temper is being more,0
1628,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_42.wav, revert to ad hominem like attacks but I didn't like that's not maybe I was like maybe I was criticizing her worldview but I wasn't like well you're an idiot you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort yeah I'm glad you understand,0
1629,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_43.wav, an event or I don't know if I necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory I would say an issue that I have is not being able to remember in as much detail as I would like to remember feelings and moments not stories like my life doesn't always think together until like a coherent story it's like this moment in that moment in this moment in that moment yeah,0
1630,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_44.wav, tell me about the hardest decision you've ever had to make,0
1631,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_45.wav, I guess I'm having a hard time recalling a moment where I like had to choose between,0
1632,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_46.wav, two options like no there's no like Sophie's Choice type moment in my life,0
1633,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_47.wav, but I but I do think that the decision cuz I lived in New York for a while I went to school in New York and the decision to leave New York after having lived there for five years was it was very very difficult,0
1634,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_48.wav, and but I had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all my core group of friends were either likely were Muslim we're leaving and going other places in the world and then the one other person or as close to it was living with someone who I did not get along with it all so it's like the situation where I didn't lose either going to live with people who I wasn't his clothes with or Craigslist or or move home and I think it was a tough decision to to leave that the only way I could do it I had to justify it by saying that I would be moving back to New York with in like a month or two which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that I could leave New York,0
1635,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_49.wav, you was how hard was that or how hard is how hard was that,0
1636,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_50.wav, it was it was just a very like isolating ice is also like I'd felt like previously to that time I'd fallen in love with one of my closest another one of my close very close friends and,0
1637,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_51.wav, badly and so I wasn't on speaking terms with her and I couldn't like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like closer to her her it was quite like her me type thing but that that was the way that I kind of,0
1638,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_52.wav, saw it at the time so I didn't like you know just being socially isolated,0
1639,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_53.wav, how easy is it for you to get a good night's sleep was recently it's been awful,0
1640,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_54.wav, I like to eat so the last last night I slept for like 10 and a half hours which seems to be the length of time that I have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night,0
1641,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_55.wav, so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that I got four hours in 2 hours of sleep cuz I was working on sat and I would get back and either and I just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's,0
1642,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_56.wav, not immediately I just initially upon waking up like I really enjoy being up in the early morning,0
1643,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_57.wav, and I also stopped drinking caffeine like I've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days I hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so,0
1644,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_58.wav, I guess with with caffeine in my system I'm ready to I'm ready to go without caffeine it's I'm just I'm just quieter I guess,0
1645,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_59.wav, changing my thoughts yeah I mean I guess when having just moved here and there is a. Of time like at the beginning where the,0
1646,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_60.wav, the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people. They moved here cuz I have a group of friends here or couple of friends I don't have like a large number friends and the the push 2,0
1647,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_61.wav, to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure is pretty overwhelming at first and I think that I'm slowly like,0
1648,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_62.wav, and moving in a moving past it at but not like it's still it's still there the pressures there but I'm just you know,0
1649,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_63.wav, I think the last time I felt really happy,0
1650,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_64.wav, was during the writing process of salt last year I shot a movie co-wrote co-directed co-produced,0
1651,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_65.wav, and that was kind of like that it still consumes my life but I think that during the,0
1652,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_66.wav, writing stages of that movie in which we would like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative,0
1653,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_67.wav, energy between me and the person riding it in,0
1654,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_68.wav, and there is like probably like a good day that I remember where it's just I remember going to bed and I was just so thrilled to be working on when I was working on and and and working with the person I was working with and like,0
1655,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_69.wav, I felt like it yeah I guess that was the the last time that was that was like more than a year ago though but I guess it's hard it's hard to think that I haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy especially if you're doing it basically by yourself with with like kind of like you can't too much else to do,0
1656,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/380_P_seg_70.wav, except like accepting of other people and always very empathic,0

1740,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_4.wav, oh that's see everything has plus and minuses cold-weather not as much sun so I think I'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm-weather so but other than that it's it's very pretty back their natural scenery in but I like it here you know the traffic is kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with,0

1744,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_8.wav," I was working in Social Services but I've also worked in sales and most recently I'm doing real estate, leasing consultant part-time",0
1745,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_9.wav, I mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not I don't really see too many negatives,0
1746,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_10.wav, oh probably to work as a gossip columnist it TMZ or one of those networks but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with cats you know animals,0
1747,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_11.wav, I'm very outgoing in fact I think I'm so echoing I scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet you know Reserve people out there so I'm kind of East Coast very you know I go up to people and talk to them first social,0

1751,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_15.wav, I can't really remember so that's why I said there's not very many arguments usually I avoid arguments at any cost so,0
1752,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_16.wav, I don't really feel guilty about anything right now or that I can think of,0
1753,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_17.wav, I really can't think of any decisions that were really hard I mean most of it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision so I don't have a family so if I have to you know I had to moves to San Francisco for a job once but since I'm single it's I don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so kind of makes certain things easier when you don't have other family to consider,0
1754,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_18.wav, well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so I know when my father died you know I mean I wish I would have had him for a lot longer and he died at the age of 77 and you know what have been nice to have him around a little bit more,0
1755,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_19.wav, but you know I can't control those things life has its own way of dealing with that,0
1756,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_20.wav, yes there are Yin and Yang that's ancient philosophy and it really applies here is pluses and minuses the negatives and positives so,0

1763,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/386_P_seg_27.wav, as I said before tire has a combination of the weather you know I'm here in Los Angeles right now we have been having very gray days I live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn't come out that much so I'm not getting my serotonin I need that I am I getting my 8 hours of sleep because you know whatever and I think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of creating you know I have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the Sun comes out I'm kind of more energetic it just gives you that more energy,0

2427,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/413_P_seg_25.wav, well I guess the hardest decision I made which I didn't really realize that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to go after you graduate high school where you go to college because for me I've basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own,0
2428,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/413_P_seg_26.wav, so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like the progression of The Next Step but looking back now that's probably one of the hardest decisions I made,0

3066,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/438_P_seg_7.wav, just the joy of watching what you put into being a parent everyday and seeing how just with love and nurturing and the right and you know when I can take proper development but just with you know love and nurturing how a baby grows into a toddler into you know a young boy to a teenager and an Italian man is so that experience alone has been rewarding just watching my sons grow up and go through these different stages and see how they have developed and you know seeing some of the things that they are going through now that's so reminiscent of my teenage years and it's just it's very rewarding in and actually I look forward to maybe even being a foster parent later down the line when they're older and often college cuz I really love children giving back,0
3067,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/438_P_seg_8.wav, for me being a single parent is the financial well I would say that along with some of the emotional with them having to Bear the brunt of the responsibility of just child child rearing you know the just the everyday things so what you have to deal with sometimes when you just tired you don't want to be bothered or you're trying to do things for yourself you have to be reminded that okay I got to cook or had to go pick my son up for I had to take him to baseball practice this one wants to go for hear this one is acting Moody and you know just those those types of challenges that's what was the financial and you know making sure you know you're able to put food on the table you're paying your rent and you know you keeping up with the day today and that's those two are probably the hardest things for me to deal with,0

3071,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/438_P_seg_12.wav, a couple probably but I would say ultimately would be traveling like working as like a travel writer going to different destinations trying different foods out writing about different people cultures learning in living you know about those different people and culture living amongst the you know that the people there and being interacted with the children and stuff like that so I kind of hope to be able to do that one day but yes it would be something along those lines and then the fall back will be the counselor and social worker something in that area if I could Encompass all three hopefully I can that I would like to do that,0
3072,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/438_P_seg_13.wav, that's a hard question probably because I initially grew up very shy in the not so much shy as I am reserved now but not Concerta but just reserved in you know what I go somewhere I'm checking everything everybody else out and then once I become comfortable or activates his situation and I'm like okay you know I warm up to the to the situation of the people but I'm also friendly I can be very friendly and outgoing you like to talk you know I seem like a chatterbox but I'm not really so usually if I'm in a big space with the whole lot of people I don't like to be the center of attention I can attach myself to one or two people and you know become friendly with them but I overall I am open Friendly person,0

4066,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_2.wav, Oklahoma's very different Ellie is a lot more exciting there's a lot more to do here and the ocean obviously is very nice,0
4067,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_3.wav, you know that's a good question I I wanted to try something new and I've always loved the beach and I thought I also like big cities so I thought La might be a good place for me to come,0
4068,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_4.wav, very it's probably one of the best decisions I ever made,0
4069,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_5.wav, Kizi I think it seems kind of natural that seems like a good fit I just really like it here,0
4070,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_6.wav, that's great I have a couple of roommates and we get along really well I live a couple of blocks from the beach and every day I get to walk on the beach or you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice,0
4071,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_7.wav, I studied philosophy and political theory in government and did a little bit of English literature on the side,0
4072,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_8.wav, it kind of just happened naturally I think I went to a liberal arts school and got kind of exposure to a lot of different areas and I just followed what I liked was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that,0
4073,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_9.wav, not exactly I work for an educational non-profit so I work with grad with graduate students in the social sciences and Humanities but I don't actually use my philosophy background very often,0
4074,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_10.wav, you know I haven't actually study to become a success coach and so I working with students has is kind of a nice aspect of of doing that but I'd really like to work with with other people so I'm not just students but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams,0
4075,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_11.wav, hey it it's fairly hard I'm in the sense that,0
4076,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_12.wav, you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all the work that needs to be undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but it's also a challenge because making a living at it requires charging people money so I'm finding people who are willing to pay for that can be difficult to,0
4077,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_13.wav, I'm pretty good in one-on-one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a couple of people I very much an observer so I tend to listen a lot and I'm not as engaged and I think that is something that goes it is noticed by others and it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted so I bet say and it's also challenge 10 not to be the person who introduces myself in a room full of strangers,0
4078,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_14.wav, pretty good I think but I do have a temper so I can get I can get upside from time to time,0
4079,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_15.wav, really it can be a challenge when I'm driving but other than that no,0
4080,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_16.wav, it would have probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would have been a friendly argument probably with one of my liberal friends so but I actually can't remember the specific time,0
4081,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_17.wav, I meditate I do that almost every day I also walk at the beach I love the ocean and I really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful and I like to read and be alone just with my thoughts so that's nice,0
4082,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_18.wav, having a hard time coming up with anything I mean I'm sure there are plenty of things just nothing comes to mind,0
4083,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_19.wav, well this isn't exactly an event it's with the dream and it's not a particularly traumatic dreams as far as dreams go but I do have it sometimes probably more often than I like so I wouldn't be upset if it even if I didn't have it and it's just a version of a dream that I think a lot of people probably have but it's usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven't gone to class taking the exams know I'm going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why did my studying attend class the way I should have which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now I have the stream sometimes and it's kind of frustrating and I'm not exactly sure,0
4084,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_20.wav, why I mean I know why but I don't know what it applies to because it's not like I am worried consciously at least about failing things so,0
4085,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_21.wav, no I don't think so at least not not that I'm aware of,0

4087,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_23.wav, well I have a brother I'm very close to him he's younger and,0

4089,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_25.wav, 545 other kids most of them with several children of their own so I have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and so we stay in touch a little bit through Facebook and they're a couple that I talk to you on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so,0
4090,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_26.wav, I have a lot of friends I think that have been positive influences,0
4091,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_27.wav, when I came out to California and I started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place is very different from what I was used to it was a little bit challenging and she also work there so we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of I would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general and now she's moved to Vegas which is a little bit tough for me but we're going to Napa this weekend so that should be good but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when I came out here to really know anybody in a know since I'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends is really nice because we share a lot of same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know I think she kind of gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice,0
4092,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_28.wav, I'm a sleeper so it's pretty easy sometimes my you know depending on how long I've been awake I can be without a little wound up and somehow got to take a little while to decompress but I usually meditate right before I go to bed and that's very helpful and I can sleep,0
4093,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_29.wav, I generally sleep in 90-minute Cycles so usually six or seven and a half hours but I can easily sleep 9 hours if I have the time and inclination I usually don't wake up in the middle of the night or at least if I do I don't remember it so,0
4094,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_30.wav, well I actually don't sleep very well when I travels one of the things I do for work is I travel quite a bit because I work for a company that's back East so I work from home most of the time but then I travel like one week a month and when I travel I'll take the red-eye and then I'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so I don't sleep that much it's not that I sleep poorly or badly it's just that I don't have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay usually the second day it's not very good sounds like a lot more tired and it's harder to concentrate and I don't know it just feels like more of a struggle,0
4095,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_31.wav, good summerisle is an is a busy time for the organization that I work for so I'm a little I don't know stressed is the right word but you know a little anxious about everything going well this summer but in general I'm feeling pretty good,0

4097,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_33.wav, he's a lot of fun and he really likes me and I really like him and we play a lot of games and talked a lot and actually doing a book club now so we're going to Skype and may God is more time with him that way but just being around him is fun,0

4100,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_36.wav, I wish I had more self-discipline so I wish that you know I could die it or eat healthier foods and not have a problem with sugar because I love to eat sugar I wish that I would not procrastinate because I've gotten a lot better about that but I still do and I can be challenging and I wish that I,0
4101,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_37.wav, I wish that I was in a relationship so,0
4102,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_38.wav, so the last organization I used to work at I had a boss and she was I don't feel like she was,0
4103,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_39.wav, I don't think we were very compatible and she used to push my buttons or so I thought and so,0
4104,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_40.wav, a one day she was really upset about something because a board member had called her up and asked her a question if she didn't have the answer and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was but it wasn't I I've been a manager for many years and I have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with with staff members and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate I thought I meant she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel incompetent or at least that's the way that I felt about it and,0
4105,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_41.wav, I did you know I tried to be very calm and said that I would take care of it and I did take care of it but after that our relationship wasn't really the same and I ended up leaving there to go back to the old organization that I work for not that long afterwards because I just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interactions,0
4106,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_42.wav, so I heard this piece of advice the other day and or this thing and then I thought it's really profound and I wish that I had read it back then which is when you think about buying something instead of thinking oh here's this beautiful coat it's $100 I want it I'm going to buy it I don't think of it is costing $100 think of it is costing 10 times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently you would have 10 times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and I think I've been much more consumer than a saber and so I wish that I had to been more aware of that 10 or 20 years ago,0
4107,/home/biswajit/Documents/jupyter_scribe/AVEC_2019/data/segmented_more_3s/train/477_P_seg_43.wav, they asked me to be his god parent and his Guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because of it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that I was a good person the kind of person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so,0
